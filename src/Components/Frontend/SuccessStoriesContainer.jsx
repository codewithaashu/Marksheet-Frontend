            Hyderabad - TwoCircles.net: Auto driver's son Mohammed GauseJani has
            topped Engineering, Agriculture and Medicine Common Entrance Test
            2010 (EAMCET) in its engineering stream. EAMCET is conducted by JNT
            University Hyderabad on behalf of Andhra Pradesh State Council of
            Higher Education (APSCHE). Jani with 159 out of 160 marks has shared
            the top rank in the engineering stream with two other candidates --

              All the Students of Super30, Bihar's Free Coaching Centre Cracked
              IIT-JEE This Year
            </h1>
            All the 30 students of Super 30, Bihar's free coaching centre for
            poor students in Patna, cracked IIT-JEE this year. "All the 30
            students have cleared IIT-JEE," Anand Kumar, the institute's
            director-cum-founder said at a press conference on Wednesday. It is
            a matter of great pleasure as we have achieved it again, he said,
            adding that since the inception of the coaching centre in 2002, a
            total of 212 students have cleared IIT-JEE examination, which is
            considered as one of the toughest examinations in the world. "We are
            now going to expand this to 60 students, so that more people can
            benefit," he added. Kumar said the students hail from very poor
            families and commit themselves to a year of 16-hour study each day
            after passing a competitive test to get into the coaching centre.
            The celebration after the results are also unique at the institute -
            a meal shared by all 30 students of Super 30. One of the students at
            the institute RichirSinha said," I wish my rank was higher." "Now we
            will try to arrange loans for the education of the poor students who
            qualified for IITs," he said. Kumar, who himself missed a chance to
            study at Cambridge due to lack of money, gives full scholarships
            including room and travel to the students. When contacted Shubham
            Kumar Gautam from Nalanda, whose father is a poor farmer with income
            less than Rs 2500 per month, said he would not have been able to
            qualify for IIT had Super 30 not helped him. The institute figured
            in Best of Asia list of Time magazine a fortnight ago. Contributions

            http://WWW.IRFI.ORG The Washington Post on June 2, ran an article,
            which citing Pentagon sources, claimed that India had decided to
            move its indigenously-developed Prithvi medium-range ballistic
            missile to Jalandhar near its border with Pakistan. The missile
            could easily strike targets well into the Pakistani heartland if it
            has actually been deployed at Jalandhar. As a retaliatory measure,
            Pakistan would feel compelled to install its own M-11 missiles at
            appropriate locations. Before long the two adversaries, could
            willy-nilly become involved in a financially costly and
            strategically destabilizing venture. Many will be surprised to know
            that the Indian Missiles were developed by a Muslim Indian
            Scientist. The following is a very brief account of some of the
            Muslim Scientists chosen randomly and their contribution to science
            and medicine in India. The author regrets that many well deserving
            Muslim Scientists have not been included in this article, however it
            is unintentional or lack of information on them. The Embassy of
            India in Washington, D.C. could not render any help to the author in
            this regard.

            Dr.Arvul Pakir Jainulabedin Abul Kalam, popularly known as Dr.
            A.P.J. AbulKalam, caught national and international attention as
            "India's Missile Man" with the successful launching of 'Agni' from
            Chandipur(Orissa) on May 22, 1989. Born in 1931 at Rameshwaram in
            Tamil Nadu, Dr.AbulKalam is a DMIT (Diploma from the Madras
            Institute of Technology) in Aero Engineering. He was awarded a
            Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degree (HonorisCausa). He was
            Director-in-charge of ASL-V mission at Indian Space Research
            Organization (ISRO) before becoming the Director of the Defense
            Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) which is located in
            Hyderabad, in Andhra Pradesh. He is a Fellow of the Indian Academy
            of Sciences. Dr.AbulKalam is the brain behind "Agni"; the
            indigenously developed 17 meter long and 75 ton multiple stage
            missile with a payload of 1000 kg (kilogram). Its range is anywhere
            between 1600 km (kilometers) to 2500 km. He was assisted by a
            400-strong team of scientists. Due to his team's efforts, India
            overcame the stipulations made by the seven Western Countries'
            Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) to deny missile technology
            to the third world countries. According to the eminent space
            scientist, "our indigenous missile technology is comparable to the
            best in the East or the West with its re-entry technology guidance
            and control technology with on-board computers." Dr. APJ AbulKalam,
            who hails from Tamil Nadu, worked on projects such as 'Prithvi',
            etc. at the DRDL in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. For his contributions
            to India's Missile Program and the successful detonation of Nuclear
            Weapons in May 1998, he was appointed as Advisor to the Defense
            Minister and subsequently awarded "Bharat Ratna" the highest
            civilian award by the Government of India.

              M. Ahmed - Founder of 'Cardinal Geometry'
            </h1>
            Mr. M. Ahmed, IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer, is the
            author of a Calendar for all years from 45 B.C. to 1999 A.D. and an
            abridged version of it for 250 years. He can tell in few seconds the
            day one was born, if he puts before him his date of birth. He has
            evolved new concepts in Mathematics, popularly known as 'Cardinal
            Geometry.' It is a new type of Geometry, which deals with the
            Mathematical Curves, surfaces and coordinates. He has also written a
            treatise on the subject. He was born to Mr. Abdul MuthalibRawther on
            November 2, 1941 at Adder (Kerala). Mr. Ahmed was the first rank
            holder in the University of Kerala in both B.Sc. (1961) and M.Sc.
            (1963) examinations in Mathematics. After a year as a lecturer in
            Mathematics in different colleges, he joined the Indian
            Administrative Service (IAS) in 1965. He was the Collector of
            Madras, Member-Secretary, Madras Metropolitan Development Authority,
            Secretary to the Government, Chairman and Managing Director of the
            Tamil Nadu Warehousing Corporation and is now Vice Chairman, Madras
            Metropolitan Development Authority. Recently he has been elevated to
            the grade of Special Commissioner. In spite of his busy schedule as
            an administrator, Mr. Ahmed spends some time in academic work and
            has made a significant contribution to the Mathematics by evolving
            new principles. The Cardinal Geometry is an innovative concept in
            Geometry, developed by Mr. Ahmed, enabling the creation and study of
            many symmetric mathematical curves and surfaces. The classical
            geometry knows only a few symmetric curves and surfaces like the
            circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, cardioid, limacon, lemniscafe,
            curves of Cassini etc., and some of their surfaces of revolution.
            Besides these curves, many lemniscafes, blimps, crescents etc. have
            been generated by him. According to Mr. Ahmed, the Cardinal Geometry
            theory could possibly be extended to the study of magnetism, motion
            of particles and bodies. It would have both theoretical and
            practical use in Engineering and Architecture.
