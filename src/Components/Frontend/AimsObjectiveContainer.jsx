          India has made progress in terms of increasing primary education
          attendance rate and expanding literacy to approximately three-fourths
          of the population. India's improved education system is often cited as
          one of the main contributors to the economic rise of India. However,
          India continues to face stern challenges. Despite growing investment
          in education, 25% of its population is still illiterate; only 15% of
          the students reach high school, and just 7% graduate. The situation at
          senior/ higher secondary education is still disheartening. The quality
          of education is significantly poor as compared with major developing
          nations. It is also not possible for the government alone to create
          infrastructure for the growing number of students at secondary and
          senior secondary level. With a mission to provide relevant continuing
          education at school stage, up to pre-degree it is, therefore,
          important to open school with public-private partnership. The
          organization has been carrying out some research work also over the
          last 3-4 years. With the aim and objective of enhancing and
          accelerating the enrolment/ retention at secondary and senior/
          secondary level, Rural Institute of Open Schooling (CSSE) was
          conceived and has been set up as an autonomous registered body under
          the Societies Registration Act, with its registered office at Delhi
