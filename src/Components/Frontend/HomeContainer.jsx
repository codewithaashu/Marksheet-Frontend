            With an objective to provide a highly flexible type of education to
            the Secondary/ Senior Secondary Education level to the children
            belonging to rural areas, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe, women
            etc., providing quality education through Open and Distance Learning
            System, to enable over-aged dropouts complete their schooling and in
            view of the need to accelerate the pace and progress of secondary
            education, especially in rural conglomeration, Rural Institute of
            Open Schooling (RIOS) has been established. India has made progress
            in terms of increasing primary education attendance rate and
            expanding literacy to approximately three-fourths of the population.
            India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main
            contributors to the economic rise of India. However, India continues
            to face stern challenges. Despite growing investment in education,
            25% of its population is still illiterate;only 15% of the students
            reach high school, and just 7% graduate. The situation at senior/
            higher secondary education is still disheartening. The quality of
            education is significantly poor as compared with major developing
            nations. It is also not possible for the government alone to create
            infrastructure for the growing number of students at secondary and
            senior secondary level. With a mission to provide relevant
            continuing education at school stage, up to pre-degree it is,
            therefore, important to open school with public-private partnership.
            The organization has been carrying out some research work also over
            the last 3-4 years. With the aim and objective of enhancing and
            accelerating the enrolment/ retention at secondary and senior/
            secondary level, Rural Institute of Open Schooling (RIOS) was
            conceived and has been set up as an autonomous registered body under
            the Societies Registration Act, with its registered office at Delhi,
            to begin with, with the following objectives: To provide secondary
            and senior secondary education those belonging to disadvantaged
            groups (e.g. the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, Socially
            and Educationally disadvantaged classes and other socially,
            culturally, economically, geographically sections of the society, or
            such other factors as may be specified/ notified by the appropriate
            Government) and people belonging to weaker sections who are not able
            to get secondary and senior secondary education in the normal course
            of life. To provide professional services to the government and
            other agencies in the field of education, in general, and school
            education, in particular, for the development and growth of distance
            and open school system and develop appropriate curriculum for
            vocational and continuing education to prepare student population
            for the world of work.
